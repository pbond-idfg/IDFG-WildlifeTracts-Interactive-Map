===================================

Idaho Fish and Game Wildlife Tracts Interactive Map.

The Wildlife Tracts program is a cooperative venture between the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the Idaho Department of Fish and Game (IDFG), and the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR).  These tracts provide islands of permanent wildlife habitat for a variety of wildlife species and allow public access for a number of recreational activities.
Wildlife Tracts consist of BLM and USBR managed land, usually surrounded by private agricultural property, and specifically managed as wildlife habitat. There are 289 tracts in the program ranging in size from 10 to 930 acres encompassing over 33,000 acres in South Central Idaho.
The success of the Wildlife Tracts program is founded in cooperation and mutual benefit. Landowners, public land managers, wildlife enthusiasts and dozens of bird and mammal species all benefit from the work accomplished through this program.

This map was created through a combination of ArcGIS Online, ArcServer, and an Esri story map template.

The initial code was downloaded from:

It was further customized to give it the IDFG look and feel and to other more functionality, such as turning map layers on/off.
